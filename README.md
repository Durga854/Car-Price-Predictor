"# Car-Price-Predictor" 
The Car Price Predictor project aims to predict the price of second-hand cars using
machine learning techniques. The project is designed to help both buyers and
sellers of second-hand cars make informed decisions based on the predicted price
of the car.

The project uses a quicker dataset of second-hand cars that includes information
such as the car name, year, company, year, price, kms driven, and other relevant
features that affect the price of the car. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any
missing or irrelevant data and normalize the numerical values.

The machine learning model used in this project is a regression model, specifically a
Linear Regression Model, which is trained on the preprocessed dataset. The model
is trained to predict the price of a car based on its features.

The project also includes a web application that allows users to enter the features
of a car and receive a predicted price. The web application uses the trained machine
learning model to predict the price of the car and display it to the user.

Overall, the Car Price Predictor project has the potential to provide valuable insights
to buyers and sellers of second-hand cars, helping them to make informed decisions
based on accurate predictions of the price of the car.
